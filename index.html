<p>"I don't speak perfectly.<br>My arguments aren't perfectly formulated.<br>Neither are anyone else's.<br>And we have to say what we have to say badly or we won't be able to think at all!"</p>
<p>"Waste no time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one"</p>
<p>"No matter how much you change, you still got to pay the price for the things you've done"</p>
